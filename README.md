A resource-saving Velocity plugin that automatically manages your Minecraft servers by starting them on demand and
shutting them down when idle, using either the [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) API or shell commands.

## Features

### 🔌 Energy & Resource Saving

Automatically shuts down empty servers after a configurable time with no players connected (default: 1 hour).

### 🚀 On-Demand Server Startup

Starts servers only when players connect, optimizing resource usage.

### 🔄 Seamless Player Experience

Redirects players to a lightweight waiting server during startup and transfers them automatically once the server is
ready.

### 🛡️ Kick Protection

Optionally redirects players to the waiting server when they are kicked from the backend server instead of disconnecting
them.

### 🔐 Whitelist Verification

Validate players against per-server whitelists before letting them join or start the server.

### 🧰 Flexible Implementation

Works with the Pterodactyl Panel API or via direct shell commands for self-hosted setups.

### ⚙️ Highly Configurable

Supports customizable shutdown delays, multiple server status check methods, and adjustable shutdown behavior on proxy
restart.  
👉 See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Quozul/PterodactylPowerAction/wiki) for full details.

### 🌐 Multilingual Support

Automatically translates messages based on the client’s language (English, German, French).

### 🔍 Diagnostic Tools

Includes a built-in doctor command to validate configuration and help troubleshoot issues.

## How it Works

When a player tries to connect to an offline server, they're temporarily sent to your waiting server while
PterodactylPowerAction starts their requested destination. Once the server is ready, they're automatically transferred.
The plugin monitors player activity and shuts down empty servers to save resources.

## Waiting/Limbo servers

Here is a small list of recommended lightweight servers software to use as waiting server:

- [PicoLimbo](https://github.com/Quozul/PicoLimbo)
- [NanoLimbo](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/86198/)
- [Limbo](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/82468/)

Note that the waiting server does not have to be a limbo server specifically, it can be any server as long as it is
always accessible. If you have a dedicated lobby server in your network, you can use that, no need for a dedicated limbo
server!

## Motivations

I am running Minecraft servers on dedicated hardware at home, I wanted to save energy costs and memory usage by stopping
empty servers. Running the waiting server on a low power ARM Single Board Computer can also further save costs.
